# Ask me anything!

I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means anything. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

## Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite.
